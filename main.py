On April 15th, 2024, Houston experienced severe thunderstorms that brought 6 inches of rain in under 12 hours. 
Localized flooding caused significant disruption, with over 150 homes reporting damage in Harris County. 
Emergency services responded to 23 high-water rescues.

Later in July, a heatwave struck the Houston area, pushing temperatures above 105¬∞F for 5 consecutive days. 
This led to at least 8 reported heat-related hospitalizations and strained the local energy grid, resulting in rolling blackouts.
